Facial Skin Disease Detection through Image Processing using CNN And Consultation Website

Our project centers on developing an innovative solution for facial dermatology detection, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and advanced image analysis techniques. The motivation stems from the increasing prevalence of dermatological issues and the associated financial strain of frequent consultations. By harnessing the power of CNNs, we aim to accurately identify common facial skin conditions such as acne, blackheads, and dark spots.

Our system goes beyond mere identification; it offers personalized recommendations for dermatologically tested treatments and dietary adjustments tailored to each user's specific condition. Through comprehensive image analysis, users receive actionable insights to manage their dermatological concerns effectively.

Our ultimate goal is to provide a cost-effective and user-friendly platform for individuals to self-assess and address their facial dermatological issues. By empowering users with accessible tools for proactive management, we aim to reduce dependence on expensive consultations while enhancing overall well-being. This project embodies a holistic approach to skincare, merging cutting-edge technology with personalized care to promote healthier skin and improved quality of life.
